# AWS-EBS-Template-Helper
Template to configure your app for AWS-EBS
this is made for flask, not django although django might work here
Add your code into the folders, zip it up and it should run fine on your aws instance
please comment if you have any errors with this structure
I also have some extra modules in the requirements.txt document, specifically:
  datetime
  flask and everything that goes with it (jinja, werkzeug, etc.)
  pymysql (basically mysql but works with python 3)
  requests (useful for most webapps)
  numpy
  rauth (does oauth for you)
